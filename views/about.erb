  <h1>Why Software Development?</h1>

    <p>Overall, I have an obsession with information. This includes everything from world news, all areas of history, business, the stock market, abstract concepts, etc. There is not enough time in the day to read and take in all of the information I would like to.

    <p2>I always thought that the projects he and his company worked on were fascinating, creative and inspiring. My goal is to utilize my many years of management experience with the strengths listed in my application to become a strong Software Developer and natural leader in the Software Industry.</p2>
